## [Operators of structured programming language](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-operators)


The conditionals are an important part of the programming oriented to structures, since they allow to make decisions according to the restrictions that you want to qualify, to return a process according to the condition, within the programming there are reserved words to start the type of condition to be performed
## conditional
* [**Simple-conditional:**] Simple conditions return a boolean value just like all others, but only attribute to a condition like:
```C
    if
```
* [**Double-conditional:**] It means that two cases are being qualified that are possible and it depends on the relationship operators, occurred if both are fulfilled or only one is necessary for the whole condition to be true
```C
    if
```
* [**Multiple-conditional:**] It is very similar to the previous one but here it attributes more than two conditions and in many occasions these are made by a function to which the parameters of the multiple condition are given and return a Boolean value like 0 and 1 or TRUE FALSE. In addition there is a layered structure to qualify more than one specific case of a given variable.
```C
    if
```
* [**Nested-conditional:**] We can nest more than one conditional so that a case can be dynamically qualified in its different stages or changes.
```C
    if
```

## special reserved words (Break, continue) and concept of infinite loop
*[**Break:**] If a condition is successful we can end the process in which said condition is nested, and continue with the next process
```C
    if
```
* [**Continue:**] If a condition is met within a loop and incorporates this instruction, it will jump to the next value in that loop
```C
    if
```
* [**Infinite-loop:**] This concept is important to keep in mind since many times it can be useful in certain cases, but many times this is not given by the intention of the programmer and it is called infinite loop to that cycle that does not have a condition that determines the end of this loop
```C
    if
```


|         |*Conditional*|        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Operator | Description | Example |
|   **?:**     | It qualifies if an expression is true or false and based on this to return one of the following returns | 3 > 4? "True" : "False" FALSE |

|          | *Logical* |         |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Operator | Description | Example |
|    **&&**    | It returns True if both or more conditions are met if one is False all conditional is False | 4 > 3 && 5 > 4 TRUE |
| [OR](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii#/media/Archivo:Roadsign_of_Ii_municipality_Finland.jpg) | If any conditional is met, all conditional is True | 2 > 3 [OR](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii#/media/Archivo:Roadsign_of_Ii_municipality_Finland.jpg) 5 > 4 TRUE |
|    **!**     | In the case where all conditionals are False, it is True and upside | 2 != 2 ! 3 == 4 TRUE |

|         |*Relationship*|       |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Operator | Description | Example |
|    **==**    | If A is equal to B is True | A == B False |
|    **<**     | if A is less than B is True | 3 < 5 TRUE |
|    **>**     | If A is bigger than B is True | 3 > 5 FALSE |
|    **>=**    | if A is less or equal to B is True | 6 >= 4 TRUE |
|    **<=**    | If A is bigger or equal to B is True | 2 <= 2 TRUE |
|    **!=**    | If A is different from B is True | 3 != 3 FALSE |

## Loops
* [**For:**] The for cycle is useful to carry out a process in a determined interval, it contains 3 parameters, the first is the variable that indicates from which value it will start working, the next parameter is the condition that indicates until At what moment this process will be stopped, and the third parameter is the change that the variable receives each time the process is executed.
```C
    if
```
* [**While:**] This loop verifies a condition as a parameter and performs a process while that condition is true, at the moment that condition is false the process will not be executed.
```C
    if
```
* [**do-While:**] It has the same goal as the while loop, but unlike that structure, it will be performed at least once before the conditional is executed and returns false
```C
    if
```
