# **Clasification of programming paradigms**
## [Programming paradigms](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/)
A programming paradigm  is a style, or general approach to writing code.

* [**Declarative:**](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/)
 Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
    * [**Functional:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure.

    * [**Dataflow:**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-functional-data-flow-programming) States that a program can be expressed as a directed graph through which data “flows” from start to finish. 

    * [**Logic / Constraint based:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. The main emphasize is on the knowledge base and the problem.

    * [**Template-Based:**](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=4LTNZ2VhVFoC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=template+based+paradigm+programming&source=bl&ots=roKDw2yU_0&sig=ACfU3U2zN8k0wK447Pjh5xtsORKoyinGkw&hl=es&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCttnfjp3pAhWyVN8KHcqmDO4Q6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=template%20based%20paradigm%20programming&f=false) Code is generated by instantiating some kind of code template with some parameters (the domain-specific program).

* [**Structured:**](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/) Is a kind of imperative programming where control flow is defined by nested loops, conditionals, and subroutines, rather than via gotos. Variables are generally local to blocks (have lexical scope).

* [**Imperative:**](http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/ComS541Fall97/hw-pages/paradigms/major.html) Assumes that the computer can maintain through environments of variables any changes in a computation process.

    * **Von Neumann**:


    * [**Interpreted (scripting):**](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/scripting.pdf)
 Assumes that a collection of useful components already exist in other languages. They are intended not for writing applications from scratch but rather for combining components.
    * [**Object-oriented:**](http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/ComS541Fall97/hw-pages/paradigms/major.html#object) Real-world objects are each viewed as seperate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures, called methods.


## Implementation metods

* [**Interpreted programming:**](https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/380/Chap1-Lang-Impl.html) It directly excecute source language programs, it fetch source programm, decode it and execute it, the interpreter excecutes while program executing.

* [**Compiled programming:**](https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/380/Chap1-Lang-Impl.html) It translate program from source language to target language, it program in target language is then executed, the compiler finished before program executed.

# [Version control](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-is-version-control)

Version control is software that allows you to manage changes to files over time. You can use version control tools to version code, binary files, and digital assets. 

A distributed version control system ([DVCS](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-dvcs-anyway)) is a type of version control where the complete codebase — including its full version history — is mirrored on every developer's computer. It's abbreviated DVCS. Git is a distributed version control system.

Advantages:
* Branching and merging can happen automatically and quickly
* Developers have the ability to work offline
* Multiple copies of the software eliminate reliance on a single backup

It is important that the version control software has the following characteristics:

* Concurrent Development
* Automation
* Team collaboration
* Tracked changes
* High availability
