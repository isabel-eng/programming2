## **C programming**

### Types of variables

 * int: Integer value
 * float: Float value
 * Char: Character (letters and special characters)
 * Char[]: String (various characters)
 * void: Void (no return value)
 * *ptr: pointer (direction in memory)
### Others
 *const: value that can't change after being assign

### Operators
 * &&: and
 * ||: or
 * <: greather or less than 
 * <=: greater or equal than
 * =>: less or equal than
 * =: equal(assing)
 * ==: equal to (compare)
 * !=: Desequal 
 * -: substraction
 * +: addition
 * ++: Increase 1
 * --: Decrease 1
 * *: multiplication
 * **: power to
 * /: division
 * %: residual
 
 ### Types of loops
 * For: process made when three sentences are true.
 * If: perform an instruction if a condition is met.
 * Else: perform an instruction if any condition is met.
 * While: perform the instructions until the contidition stops being true.
 * Struct: declare a structure that would be used in the main code.

### Types of processes 
 * Printf: print the output
 * Scanf: scan for the code an input from the user
 * a = b ? c : d: Ternary operator
 * randoom: randoom function



### Dynamic memory
 * malloc: dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
 * calloc: clean and asing a space memory for the variable.
 * realloc: dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory.
 * free: dynamically de-allocate the memory.


### Files
 * FILE: indicates that a file is being use.
 * fscanf: reads formatted input from a stream.
 * fprintf: writes into a file.
 * fclose: closes a file.
 * fopen: creates a new file in a mode:
 * strlen: counts the characters in a string.
 * size of: size of a file in bytes.

#### Files modes
 * a: append
 * a+: reading + appending
 * w: writes in a file 
 * w+: reading + writing (over writes in the file)
 * r: read a file
 * r+: reading + writing (new data over the old one)




## **Python programming**

input: takes a string from the user.
in: defines where information should be taken for the code.
with: runs the code using certain file.
any: selects everithing in a range.
range: defines a range of numbers.
break: ends an action in the code.
list: creates a list of objects.

### Operators
 * and: and
 * or: or
 * not: avoidance of a value
 * <: greather or less than 
 * <=: greater or equal than
 * =>: less or equal than
 * =: equal(assing)
 * ==: equal to (compare)
 * !=: Desequal 
 * -: substraction
 * +: addition
 * ++: Increase 1
 * --: Decrease 1
 * *: multiplication
 * **: power to
 * /: real division
 * //: exact division 
 * %: residual

 ### Types of loops
 * For: process made when three sentences are true.
 * If: perform an instruction if a condition is met.
 * Else: perform an instruction if any condition is met.
 * While: perform the instructions until the contidition stops being true.

### Files
 * open(): opens the file.
 * close(): closes the file.
 * write(): writes in the file.
 * read(): reads the file.
 * .append: Takes a value and puts it at the end of a list.
 * .write: Writes in a file data from the user.
 * .count: Returns the number of elements with the specified value.
